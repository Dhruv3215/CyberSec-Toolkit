🚀 CyberSec Toolkit 🚀
=====================

Tagline: Empowering Cybersecurity Professionals with Innovative Tools and Technologies

📖 Description
-------------------

The CyberSec Toolkit is an open-source project designed to provide a comprehensive suite of tools and utilities for cybersecurity professionals. The project is aimed at addressing various challenges faced by security teams, including password cracking, wordlist generation, and hash cracking. The toolkit is built using a combination of Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS, making it a versatile and flexible solution for a wide range of cybersecurity applications.

The CyberSec Toolkit is divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific area of cybersecurity. These modules include password strength assessment, wordlist generation, and hash cracking. The toolkit also includes a web-based interface for easy access and a command-line interface for more advanced users.

✨ Features
----------------

1. Password Strength Assessment: The toolkit includes a password strength assessment module that uses a combination of algorithms to evaluate the strength of a given password. The module takes into account factors such as password length, complexity, and common patterns.

2. Wordlist Generation: The toolkit includes a wordlist generation module that generates a list of words based on a set of parameters. The module can generate words of varying lengths, complexity, and character sets.

3. Hash Cracking: The toolkit includes a hash cracking module that uses a combination of algorithms to crack hashes. The module can crack hashes of varying lengths and complexities.

4. Web-Based Interface: The toolkit includes a web-based interface that provides easy access to the toolkit's features. The interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

5. Command-Line Interface: The toolkit includes a command-line interface for more advanced users. The interface provides a set of commands that can be used to access the toolkit's features.

6. Password Cracking: The toolkit includes a password cracking module that uses a combination of algorithms to crack passwords. The module can crack passwords of varying lengths and complexities.

7. Hash Generation: The toolkit includes a hash generation module that generates hashes of varying lengths and complexities.

8. Wordlist Search: The toolkit includes a wordlist search module that allows users to search for specific words or patterns in the generated wordlists.

9. Hash Search: The toolkit includes a hash search module that allows users to search for specific hashes or patterns in the cracked hashes.

📁 Project Structure
-------------------------

The CyberSec Toolkit project is divided into several folders and files, each with a specific purpose. The project structure is as follows:

 `app.py`: The main application file that imports and initializes the toolkit's modules.
 `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the toolkit's visual style.
 `main.js`: The JavaScript file that defines the toolkit's web-based interface.
 `password_strength.py`: The Python file that defines the password strength assessment module.
 `wordlist_gen.py`: The Python file that defines the wordlist generation module.
 `hash_cracker.py`: The Python file that defines the hash cracking module.
 `utils`: The folder that contains utility functions and modules.
 `static`: The folder that contains static files such as images and CSS files.
